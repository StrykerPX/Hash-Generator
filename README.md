# Hash-Generator 
A text hashing test software made with Visual Studio 2019 .NET Framework 4.7.2 that uses SHA256, 384, and 512 to generate a hash depending on the input.
It can also covert the generated hash into a string of binary numbers. This was my attempt on get a better understanding of how hashing algorithm work and how it is applied in C#.
