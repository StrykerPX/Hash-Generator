# Hash-Generator 
A text hashing test software made with Visual Studio 2019 .NET Framework 4.7.2 that uses SHA256, 384, and 512 to generate a hash depending on the input.
It can also covert the generated hash into a string of binary numbers. This was my attempt on get a better understanding of how hashing algorithm work and how it is applied in C#. This application isn't something imporessive. If you want to just see the source code or just simply want a hashing sofware like this for some reason, feel free to check it out yourself
## Instruction
The application itself should be pretty straightforward. Enter your text onto the upper textbox and choose the type of hashing you would like to apply to the text.
Changing the hash type will automatically generate the hash. In case you want to hash using the already selected hash, click generate on the bottom right corner.
